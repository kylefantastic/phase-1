#### We suggest using the relative path instead of the absolute path. Can you think of why?
**About relative and absolute paths:**

In order to remember what is the difference between absolute and relative path, it’s easy: an absolute path will always include de domain naim of a website, such as http://… when a relative link will directly point to... a path! On clicking a relative link, the web browser takes him to the location of the site and this is the reason why you can only use relative when linking contents of your own site. Absolute links will be used to link external ressources such as other websites.

#### What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
**Phase 1: Information Gathering**

First of all a designer must understand who he works for and what are the corporate values the client wants to corroborate through the design of his project. It means the designer must have a deep understanding of both the field of expertise of the client and his audience in order to achieve his client’s goals.
That the reason why the beginning of the process is usually a meeting where the designer is asking as much questions as possible to the client.
A second step of creative agencies doing web design generally involve presenting a moodboard with appropriate references to the client, in order to understand what kind of project he needs and if designers are on the good direction. At this step you may also start to have many idea, that the reason why gathering must be done in an organized .txt file you want to keep update all along the project. Next step, planning.

**Phase 2: Planning**

Referring to what you understood of your client needs: navigation, degree of expected pixel perfectness, responsiveness you have to start considering what technologies will need to be implemented.
At this phase you have already sketched a site-map in order to have an idea of the amount of work required by each part of the project. It’s important to understand that some clients are going to need basic things that won’t require much time and some others will want more complex implementations such as CMS or APIs. An other important though about client is that, often, they don’t event know what they need so you have to teach them what is a CMS and the interest of using it for example. Once you have worked on all those points you should have an overall idea of how long the whole process of building the client dream app will take and you can start organize your time.

**Phase 3: Design**

Regarding to the aim of the website and its target-audience, the look-n-feel should be totally different. For example, a one-page site build for a teenager clothes shop will use different visual codes than a website designed for U.S ambassy. So, first of all, the designer must start building his toolbox: typefaces, color palettes, iconography, copywritting and textual treatment. It's important to understand that on web projects, ui is mostly made out of type, so any conscious designer will spend a lot of time investigating in order to find the apropriate typefaces.
Then, the designer is going to use a prototyping tool, such as photoshop, indesign or sketch3 in order to go from the sketched layouts to the wireframe step and then to mockups. For this purpose, he will create several prototypes of the site, including some details and ideas he can have about the code (JS/CSS most of the time). It's important that developers and designers collaborate on the design process so they can both keep on eye on the potential constraints one solution can imply. Once the prototype is ready, generally wireframes but sometimes mock-ups, the development can begin…

**Phase 4: Development**

The developmental is the step where the web site itself is built. Teams generally start by building an index followed by a "shell" for the interior pages. Shell can be understood like a template for the content pages of the site and contains the navigational structure of the site. Once the shell has been created, your designer will take your content and distribute it throughout the site, in the appropriate areas such as images, typefaces, css and so on.
The idea behind collaborating with designers is that, most of the time, when implementing features of the site, the designer is working on the design improvement while the developper is building application rails.

**Phase 5: Testing and Delivery**

Web designers will test all possible clickable things on a web site to ensure it can be viewed properly in the most recent browsers and if your client need to old browsers such as internet explorer 8. Valid code means that your site meets the current web development standards, this is important designers are checking for issues such as forms or running scripts ensuring they all work properly.
Then, it is time to deliver the site with a FTP program is used to upload the web site files to your server. Other final details include plugin installation for analytics and SEO purposes. Basically adding javascript tags that will help your web site achieve higher rankings in the search engines and track your visitors.

**Phase 6: Maintenance**

For clients that prefer to be more hands on, and update their own content, there is something called a CMS. With a Content Managing System, your designer will utilize online software to develop a database driven site for you. A web site driven by a CMS gives you the ability to edit the content areas of the web site yourself. You are given access to a back-end administrative area, where you can use an online text editor. Maintenances types can also include regular site backups, WordPress upgrades, additional plugin installation, updating cdn links to newer versions of frameworks, etc.

#### What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
**My site primary goad is being my creative coding vitrine. Allowing users to interact with various kind of contents such as showing my work and my implication in the community:**

**1. Finest web works presented as products, maybe:**

  1. Applications
  2. Scripts
  3. CSS wizardries
  4. Websites
  5. Design templates
  6. Tools
  7. ...

**2. Link to blog article sumarry**

  1. posts summary -> post content

**3. About me (img+text)  and link in order to get in touch with me:**

  1. Twitter
  2. Mail
  3. Linkedin
  4. Github?

#### What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
Considering my site as a portfolio I’d say my audience is a mix of **front-end designers**, **developers**, **business people and wider IT community**.
My site is addressing them as an audience aware of coding, using technical appropriate langage instead of pseudo-communicant approach.

#### What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site?
**Scrolling down** in order to discover the work list should be the first action when coming to my site. Work list should always start featuring my latest work.
Also as the main component of the page, work list, must be well designed to occupy page space and attack visitor eye by using lovely placeholder image/icon for each project. An important thing is keeping in mind last work always have to be featured first, but only finest works have to be part of the list.

#### Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
**On one hand, first time visitor:**
He should check my latest work because your last work, even if not your favorite always show you are up to date with fresh front-end frameworks and latest technologies. Then, navigate to other works if they want to know more about my previous works.

**On the other hand, used visitor:**
He should have an easy access to links to get in touch with me without needing to scroll. ( Also, maybe link to the blog)

#### What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
As industry’s technologies and methodologies advance making websites and web apps becoming more complex.
Fifteen years ago, users were interacting with static contents because of the basic technologies and fabrication processes. Nowadays, thanks to new technologies, the user is exposed to various, rich and interactives experiences, making the web project success hinging on one thing: how does users perceive it.
Unconsciously, every time an user becomes a visitor of your website, he is asking himself, how easy is the website to use, how pleasant, and how much he is enjoying navigating on your website.
Design and UX are asking those questions and trying to find the most appropriate solutions in order to provide to the user a decent, fresh and up-to-date experience while browsing the site.

#### What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
UX solve problems and keep users on your site preventing from churning! Seriously, it is basicaly how a user feels when interfacing with a website, a web application or desktop software. User experience design consists in making the experience as good as possible for the user by designing it. The process of Ui design generally conciste in making user scenaris trying to optimize the navigation between most important parts of the application. On existing projects, UX designers study and evaluate how users feel about a system. looking at such things as ease of use, perception of the value of the system, site heatmaps, utility, efficiency in performing tasks and so forth.
Nowadays, users are accessing websites in an increasing number of ways: various devices, browsers, different types of Internet connections. UX designers have to think a new, cross-device and cross-browsers ways to create their projects, permanently iterating on both design and coding best practices. The ultimate goal is designe an only one perfect version working on all plateforms because this will always be better for the client (working with contents) and also easier to maintain than several differents projects for several different platforms. QED Valuable.

#### Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Reflecting on User experience was tedious because I worked one year as an Ui/Ux designer and there are so much things to say going beyound the material. The most important is probably that neither the designer nor the developer have to stop trying to understand what does the work of the other consists in. Best projects are made by teams of 2-3 people, with both very specific knowledge and large understanding of the user experience landscape.
